This directory contains presentation models, abstract representations of the
views (in ../views). Presentation models are responsible for providing the
views with data from the models (in ../models) in a format that minimizes the
logic that the view has to perform. For more information, see
<https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html>.

For views that have interactive components, the corresponding presentation
model provides an `Events` structure (e.g., `RecordButtonsEvents` in
./record_buttons/record_buttons.c) that is retained by the view (since the
presentation models themselves are not retained but are instead provided to
each view's `update` method). When an event occurs in the view, the
corresponding event handler method in the `Events` structure is called. Again,
this minimizes the logic that has to occur in the view.

Presentation models may provide the views with information on which pieces of
view data have changed. This is optional and not required for correctness, but
it allows views to skip certain parts of the update process to optimize
performance.
